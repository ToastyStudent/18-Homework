# 18-Homework-Social-Network-Api-Challenge

## Description
This project was built from code provided via Northwestern University's Full-stack Development Coding Bootcamp's TAs, with me rewriting code in order to ensure I understand how to properly build the app were I to attempt to do so again under less time constraints than those I am currently under.

Specifically, I used Express.js and a MongoDB database to build an API for a hypothetical social network web application wherein users are able share their thoughts, react to othersâ€™, and create a friend list.

# Installation and Usage
One must first clone this Github respoitory and then run npm i to install the various node_modules that allow the application to run.

Then, in the command line, one must run the command "node server.js" to launch the application's connection to the server.

After doing so, to use the app, one must, in a software such as Insomnia Core or Postman, test out the various GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE routes defined in the files within the [api folder of the routes folder](./routes/api/) to simulate utilizing the API of an social network.

With their express permission, I used the code provided as a template which I then modified, primarily through the renaming of elements, addition/modification of comments, and rearrangemet of variables.
